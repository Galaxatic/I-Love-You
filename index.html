		<h1>Hey...</h1>
			Who would've thought? I am still chasing you - the person I love, and it has already been a month. Yes, I'm a little silly, maybe even crazy, but that's how it is. <br> 
			Yes, you. You are the only girl that I like most - you're the person special to me. Maybe we do not communicate much, but that's because I love you and I don't want to create awkwardness between us. <br>
			You said that you will never like me, it did break my heart (a lot), but I completely understand you. Bolt had a crush on you for two years, and you never accepted him. <br>
			You can keep on saying that you will not like me forever, maybe an eternity, but I will not give up on you. There is no other girl like you. You are unique, and that's why I like you. <br>
			In my heart, you will always be smarter than me even if you think otherwise. Lately, I have been taking the chances to stare at you whenever possible. <br>
			The more I look at you, the more prettier you look and the more I like you. It's just been one month - and I have been thinking about you every day. I am serious. <br>
			For now, I will not be doing anything towards you as SA1 is ongoing and I don't want my true feelings towards you to affect your studies. I can wait for 18 May.
