		<h1>Hey...</h1>
			Who would've thought? I am still chasing you - the person I love, and it has already been a month. Yes, I'm a little silly, maybe even crazy, but that's how it is. <br> 
			Yes, you. You are the only girl that I like most - you're the person special to me. Maybe we do not communicate much, but that's because I love you and I don't want to create awkwardness between us. <br>
			You said that you will never like me, it did break my heart (a lot), but I completely understand you. Bolt had a crush on you for two years, and you never accepted him. <br>
			You can keep on saying that you will not like me forever, maybe an eternity, but I will not give up on you. There is no other girl like you. You are unique, and that's why I like you. <br>
			In my heart, you will always be smarter than me even if you think otherwise. Lately, I have been taking the chances to stare at you whenever possible. <br>
			The more I look at you, the more prettier you look and the more I like you. It's just been one month - and I have been thinking about you every day. I am serious. <br>
			For now, I will not be doing anything towards you as SA1 is ongoing and I don't want my true feelings towards you to affect your studies. I can wait for 18 May.

			I know I have stated this before in my love letter to you back on 13 April 2020 (yes I remember the date), but you know I guess I'll restate some reasons why I like you in much more detail. <br>
			1. You are PRETTY and CUTE - Your looks are dazzling and phenomenal that it is irresistible for me. That is something I definitely don't have though :( <br>
			2. You are decent at studies. - I mean, this is true. You have achieved pretty good marks last year and I am proud of you. <br> 
			I learnt some of your methods (like the Listening Comprehension one) and I applied it and was useful. I believe we might need each other in the future and that is one reason why I want to get into a relationship with you. <br>
			3. You are just a very nice person. - Even just as a friend, I think you are the nicest person in the world. You treat your friends well, you help people in need and there's so much more that the list would be endless! <br>
			I feel like I need a girl like you in my life.
			In conclusion, from the bottom of my heart, I think that you are perfect for me. You have so many character strength that I admire.

			I like you very very much and I mean it. Maybe I'm not good enough for you. I agree that I have many flaws. However, my feelings towards you authentic and I believe with you around, I will be able to change into <br>
			a better person. You motivate me to do better in both character and studies. I'm determined to be the person that you want me to be.
